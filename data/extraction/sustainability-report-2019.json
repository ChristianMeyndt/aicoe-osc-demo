Renewal, which is the closest to the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) Sustainability Development scenario, shows a way to limit global warming to well below 2C compared to the pre-industrial level. This requires rapid and significant policy tightening, global cooperation, technology developments and substantial changes in business and consumer behaviour.

Also, most of our non-sanctioned portfolio continues to be profitable, although a few non-sanctioned projects after 2025 could be challenging in such a scenario. However, these projects are still immature and will most likely improve as they are developed.
