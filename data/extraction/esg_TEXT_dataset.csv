New digital technologies are implemented to help us reach our goals of improved safety performance, reduced emissions and higher value. The integrated operations support centre, established in 2018, will be central in reducing CO₂ emissions from the NCS. Equinor has so far connected 20 of its assets to this centre, streaming data to our cloud-based data platform. By end of 2020 all operated fields on the NCS will be connected. Cross-functional teams utilise this data to discover opportunities for energy efficiency measures, safety and value improvements. Another centre, the geo-operations centre, ensures more efficient and better geoscience control of drilling operations, as well as cost savings and improved personnel safety. Further, subsurface data are connected and analysed in new ways through our subsurface data lake, enhancing the reservoir performance. Our digital field worker concept is also being broadly implemented, allowing our operators and engineers easy access to data enabling improved safety performance, higher efficiency and reduced carbon footprint. Workforce diversity and inclusion Embracing diversity and driving inclusion is a fundamental part of our values - open, collaborative, courageous and caring - and an integral part of our leadership expectations. This includes working actively to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities at Equinor. In 2019, we continued to strengthen diversity and inclusion in Equinor by embedding it into our key human resources processes, such as recruitment, succession planning, performance management and leadership development. We monitor diversity in our workforce at all levels and locations and encourage and support employee initiatives that contribute to a diverse and inclusive culture.
